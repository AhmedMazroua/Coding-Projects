Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: the time it took to run each simulation didnt increase exponentially by 10

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after 100000 it doesnt exceed 5 seconds and if more teams had to be tested the entire seconds comebined would be less than 10 seconds.
